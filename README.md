File Conversion for xTool XCS Files to SVG and other formats. 
Simple python utility to extract SVG from xTool project files. 
This is especially useful for 3d shapes already loaded into xTool, which aren't easily extractable. 
Will save several files out, for me the last file was the proper 2d representation I wanted. 

Note I used this on files saved from xTool Studio v 1.3.6
